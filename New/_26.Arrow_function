Arrow Function -
    >Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
    >Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:
     ex- hello = () => {
            return "Hello World!";
            }

    >It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and return keyword:

    Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:
    ex-     hello = () => "Hello World!";
